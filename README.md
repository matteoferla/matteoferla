- 👋 Hi, I’m @matteoferla
- 📛 I’m a computational biochemistry and chemistry
- 💻 I code in Python at an expert level, but recently I have become addicted to using the Gify API to add GIFs to my ssh–port-forwarded jupyterlab notebooks during boring :pandas dataframe polishing 🐼💤🧹+ 🤡 = 😍
- ⌛ Ignoring GW Basic and Pascal, I started coding properly in Perl. Despite my years glued to a keyboard I am proud that I managed to refuse to learn R. And I inted to keep it that way. (Matlab is a different matter).
- 🥷 I'm proficient at PyRosetta and when I have time I check the Rosetta Commons forum or add a new blog post, but if you are hitting a wall just drop me an email
- 🌐 I'm able to curse at Apache2 until it works and write in JS and HTML, but I do not easily get swayed by shiny new things —Pyramid, FastAPI and bootstrap are my goto.
- 😵‍💫 I'm one of those people who carries a photo of J. Willard Gibbs and Ludwig Boltzmann in the wallet to show hapless people at the pub who I have trapped in a monologue about molecular thermodynamics —I am just kidding, mostly: I apologise if you are one of those who have been monologued at about molecular thermodynamics but it's an attractive topic like the Lenard–Jones r^-6 term
- 📜 I'm write sciency tutorials on my blog: [blog.matteoferla.com](https://blog.matteoferla.com/). I will admit it's not as frequent as I would hope but I am always open to topic requests

- 🔨 I’m a senior postdoc in the OPIG group (Prof. Charlotte Deane, University of Oxford) and XChem (Frank von Delft, University of Oxford, 🇬🇧) working on fragment based drug discovery method development and user cases
- 🔧 I was previously a senior postdoc in the BRC Oxford Genomic Medicine theme (Prof. Jenny Taylor, University of Oxford, 🇬🇧) modelling the effect at the protein level of clinical variants from rare diseases
- 🔩 I was previously a postdoc in the group of Prof Mark Howarth (University of Oxford, 🇬🇧) engineering dogCatcher a non-invasive protein tag for labelling using isopeptide bonds
- 🪛 I was previously at BioSyntia in Copenhagen 🇩🇰 engineering _E. coli_ to produce B7
- 📖 I did my PhD in Biochemistry at the University of Central Otago 🇳🇿 in the enzymatic consequences of genome streamlining ('multitasking')
- 📘 I did my bachelors and masters at the University in Bath, my thesis was on crustacean phylogeny
